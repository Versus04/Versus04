Building Hyprland on Fedora is a straightforward process, quite similar to the steps outlined in the wiki. The primary difference lies in the package names between Arch and Fedora. These steps were successfully tested on both Fedora 35 and Fedora 36 Workstation. It's worth noting that this process was performed on a laptop using an integrated Intel video driver, as I don't have access to an AMD or Nvidia GPU for testing.

To get started, you'll need to install the required packages:


sudo dnf install ninja-build cmake meson gcc-c++ libxcb-devel libX11-devel pixman-devel wayland-protocols-devel cairo-devel pango-devel


This base set of packages will automatically bring in all the necessary dependencies. If you plan on debugging crashes, consider installing gdb as well.

Next, download the Hyprland source code:


git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland


Make sure to use the `--recursive` flag as it ensures the correct branch of wlroots is cloned into the subprojects directory. It's important to note that using the master branch of wlroots will lead to compiler errors. Instead, you need the specific branch of wlroots with the modified structures.

With the prerequisites in place, you're ready to build Hyprland. For this process, I used the ninja build system:


cd Hyprland
meson _build
ninja -C _build
sudo ninja -C _build install


While building, I encountered some compiler warnings, but fortunately, there were no errors. It's also worth mentioning that due to some missing drivers on my system, the wlroots config couldn't enable the Vulkan renderer. However, Hyprland seems to function perfectly without it. Moreover, I observed that Fedora lacks an `xcb-errors` package, so the wlroots config may not locate it.

Though you can follow the steps provided in the wiki and build using cmake, I personally prefer using ninja, so I opted for that initially.

At this point, the Hyprland installation is complete. However, I noticed that on my system, I needed to place the `Hyprland.desktop` session file where gdm could find it. This was necessary because gdm doesn't appear to search in `/usr/local/share/wayland-sessions`:

sudo cp /usr/local/share/wayland-sessions/hyprland.desktop /usr/share/wayland-sessions


Lastly, make sure to copy the sample config file into the appropriate location:


mkdir -p ~/.config/hypr
cp example/hyprland.conf ~/.config/hypr


Remember to modify the config file to match your system configuration. After making these changes, log out. You should see Hyprland listed as an option in gdm. Keep in mind that if gdm is running in an X session instead of Wayland, Hyprland might not appear as an option. Verify that Wayland is enabled in `/etc/gdm/custom.conf`. While the wiki mentions that Hyprland might crash the first time it's launched from gdm, I didn't experience this issue; Hyprland worked flawlessly from the start.
